### Why should I present and participate on the POS Café meetings ?
The POS café meetings is one the core pieces of the POS Café philosophy.
It is the perfect moment to learn or teach scientific or technical knowledge.
But it does not limit to sciences, you can present whatever you think is important to know. :)

### How can I make a presentation on the POS Café meetings ?
#### Send abstract 
Pos Café try to organise and schedule the presentations to optimize the benefit of such event.
To perform a presentation, you have to send an e-mail to the Pos Café (iagposcafe@gmail.com) inculding the duration of your presentation and a very small abstract and/or the front slide of your ppt.

Then the POS café will send an e-mail to every POS student to inform them about your presentation, as well as the date and the location. :)

#### Format
It should be short (and intense :) ), our advice is to make a 15 min long presentation (15 slides) but feel free to go up to 30 min if necessary. 

#### Template
You have to follow the .ppt template of the organization.You can find it on the template folder. The instruction are described directly on its slides.

#### Upload
After presenting you have to upload your presentation in the adequate folder or send it to POS Café which will do this for you if you are not to familiar with GitHub :)
